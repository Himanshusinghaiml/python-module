Yes, that's correct!

When you say O(n) requires 10 steps, this means that in a linear scan (O(n) approach), the algorithm would traverse through each element in the array one-by-one. For an array of size 
𝑛
=
10
n=10, it would look at each of the 10 elements and perform a constant-time operation (like comparing each element to 0 or 1).

Explanation:
In O(n) complexity:

For 
𝑛
=
10
n=10, the algorithm needs to check all 10 elements, which means it traverses the entire array of size 10 and performs 10 operations, one for each element.
For example:

Suppose the array is: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
The algorithm will check each element of the array one-by-one (10 elements) to find the first occurrence of 1 (the transition point).
In contrast, with O(log n):
For 
𝑛
=
10
n=10, binary search would require approximately 3 steps (since 
log

3.32

​
 10≈3.32, and we round this to 3).
This means the binary search algorithm wouldn't traverse all elements, but would instead split the array in half at each step, drastically reducing the number of elements to check.
Binary Search Steps Example for 
𝑛
=
10
n=10:
If the array is sorted like this: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

First Step: Check the middle element (index 5). It’s 1, so the transition point might be on the left half of the array.
Second Step: Now check the middle element of the left half (index 2). It’s 0, so the transition point must be in the right half of the array.
Third Step: Check the middle element of the remaining right half (index 4). It’s 1, which is the transition point.
So, binary search only requires 3 steps instead of traversing through all 10 elements.

To summarize:
O(n) requires a full traversal of the array, so for 
𝑛
=
10
n=10, you perform 10 steps (one for each element).
O(log n) reduces the number of steps drastically by halving the search space each time. For 
𝑛
=
10
n=10, binary search only requires 3 steps.
This difference becomes much more noticeable as n grows larger, and that's why O(log n) is so much more efficient for large arrays!

Yes, you're absolutely right! The number of steps required by O(n) and O(log n) depends on the size of the array (i.e., how many elements are in the array), but they behave differently:

O(n) means that the number of steps is directly proportional to the size of the array. If the array has n elements, the algorithm will take n steps.

For example:

If the array has 10 elements, you'll need 10 steps.
If the array has 100 elements, you'll need 100 steps.
If the array has 1,000 elements, you'll need 1,000 steps, and so on.
O(log n) means that the number of steps required grows much more slowly compared to the size of the array. As the array size grows, the number of steps grows logarithmically (not linearly). The number of steps required is proportional to log₂(n), which means it increases much more slowly than the size of the array.

For example:

If the array has 10 elements, binary search requires about 3 steps (since log₂(10) ≈ 3.32).
If the array has 1,000 elements, binary search only requires about 10 steps (log₂(1,000) ≈ 9.97).
If the array has 1,000,000 elements, binary search only requires about 20 steps (log₂(1,000,000) ≈ 19.93).
Key Differences:
O(n): The number of steps increases linearly with the size of the array. If the array size is n, you need to check each element, so you do n operations.
O(log n): The number of steps increases much more slowly with the size of the array. If the array size is n, the number of steps is about log₂(n).
Example:
For an array of size 
𝑛
=
10
n=10:
O(n) requires 10 steps (one for each element).
O(log n) requires about 3 steps (since log₂(10) ≈ 3.32).

n=1,000,000:
O(n) requires 1,000,000 steps.
O(log n) requires about 20 steps (since log₂(1,000,000) ≈ 19.93).
To summarize:
O(n) scales linearly with the size of the array.
O(log n) scales logarithmically, meaning that as the array size increases, the number of steps required increases much more slowly.
So, the number of steps depends on the size of the array, but the growth rate of the number of steps is very different for O(n) versus O(log n).
