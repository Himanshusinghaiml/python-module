Summary of Key Normal Forms:
1NF: Atomic values, no duplicates.
2NF: Eliminate partial dependencies (only depends on full primary key).
3NF: Eliminate transitive dependencies (depends only on the primary key).
BCNF: Every determinant is a candidate key.
4NF: Eliminate multi-valued dependencies.
5NF: Eliminate join dependencies (decompose without losing information).
